What is data exploration and visualization?
Data Exploration - A Complete Introduction | HEAVY.AI
Data exploration definition: Data exploration refers to the initial step in data analysis in which data analysts use data visualization and statistical techniques to describe dataset characterizations, such as size, quantity, and accuracy, in order to better understand the nature of the data

Introduction:
Data exploration techniques include both manual analysis and automated data exploration software solutions that visually explore and identify relationships between different data variables, the structure of the dataset, the presence of outliers, and the distribution of data values in order to reveal patterns and points of interest, enabling data analysts to gain greater insight into the raw data.

Data Visualization and Exploration :
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner. Process:

Data extraction: To extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a format that works for you, like CSV or JSON, clone the Github and use scripting to do it.

Data transformation: Pre-processed and altered the data using libraries like Pandas and a scripting language like Python. This could entail preparing missing numbers, cleaning the data, and formatting it so that it can be used for analysis and visualisation.

Database insertion: Connected to a MySQL database using the Python "mysql-connector-python" module, then used SQL commands to insert the converted data.

Creating a dashboard: Use the Python packages Streamlit and Plotly to build an engaging and eye-catching dashboard. The data may be shown on a map using Plotly's built-in geo map features, and Streamlit can be used to make an intuitive user interface with several dropdown menus so that users can choose which facts and figures to show.

Data retrieval: To connect to a MySQL database and retrieve data into a Pandas dataframe, use the "mysql-connector-python" module. To dynamically refresh the dashboard, use the data in the dataframe.

Concusion: This project will yield a live geovisualization dashboard with interactive and aesthetically pleasing data and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.
